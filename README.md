Inception

Inception is a system administration and infrastructure project that introduces the fundamentals of containerization and service orchestration. The project focuses on understanding how modern applications are deployed, isolated, and interconnected using container-based technologies.

Through Inception, students explore how multiple services can be structured into a coherent and maintainable infrastructure. The project emphasizes service isolation, configuration management, and controlled communication between components, reflecting real-world deployment practices used in production environments.

Beyond containerization itself, Inception highlights key concepts such as networking between services, data persistence, security considerations, and environment-driven configuration. It encourages thinking in terms of infrastructure design rather than individual applications, fostering a holistic understanding of how systems behave as a whole.
